Caleb Ortega hello world assignment 604B
Hello! My name is Caleb O and I am studying at the University of Arizona 🐻. I am currently studying Agrivoltaics as a part of **Greg Barron Gafford's research group**. I hope to use my GIS skills to 🗺️ map the effects of the [heat island](https://www.epa.gov/heatislands) on photovoltaic and eventually argivoltaic arrays.
